This is some visuals for an example of the turbulent flow through a rectangular pipe with a hydraulic diameter of $d_h=50$ mm.
The orifice is circular with a radius of $r=25$ mm. The simulation is performed using large-eddy simulation (LES).

The flow upstream is a simple plug flow with a Reynolds number of $Re=6000$.

Keep in mind that this is an example where the mesh density is not independent and results are only used for visuals.
