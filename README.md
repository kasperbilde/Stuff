# Stuff
Common repository for various stuff including images, videos and more.

## Cases
Some visuals for various cases are uploaded to this repo.

### Flow through an orifice
Some visuals of a test example of the flow through an orifice is found in the [orifice folder](https://github.com/kasperbilde/Stuff/tree/main/orifice).
Turbulence is modelled using large eddy simulations with the WALE model and the
visual results should only be taken as an example, as no grid convergence, refinement or other parameters have been validated.
